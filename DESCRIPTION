Description: Bluelink Reanalysis (BRAN2020) via NetCDF sources. Facilities to 
 query and read from BRAN2020, a 4 dimensional nearly-global ocean product.  
 The goal of BRAN is to provide a realistic quantitative description of the 
 three-dimensional time-varying ocean circulation of all physical variables 
 (temperature, salinity, sea-level and three components of velocity) for the last 
 few decades. <https://research.csiro.au/bluelink/global/reanalysis/>
